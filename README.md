## Debugger configurations

### 1. Custom Python debugger

#### **Purpose**:
This configuration is designed to debug a Python application running with Uvicorn.

#### **Configuration Details**:
```json
{
        "name": "Custom Python Debugger",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "launch",
        "module": "uvicorn",
        "args": [
        "--port", "PORT_NUMBER",
        "--host", "0.0.0.0",
        "cdp_api_foundation:get_app",
        "--reload"
        ],
        "env": {
        "REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE": "paste the outputted path of 'python -m unipass' displayed path in here",
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
        "OPENAPI_SPEC_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/src/dirr_containing_openapi_file/openapi_spec.yaml"
        },
        "console": "integratedTerminal",

}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- **`name`**: The identifier for this configuration (`Custom Python Debugger`).
- **`type`**: Specifies the debugger type (`debugpy` for Python debugging).
- **`request`**: Defines the debug request type (`launch` starts the application).
- **`module`**: The Python module to run (`uvicorn`).
- **`args`**: Command-line arguments for Uvicorn:
  - `--port`: Port number for the application.
  - `--host`: Host address (default `0.0.0.0`).
  - `cdp_api_foundation:get_app`: Specifies the app callable.
  - `--reload`: Enables auto-reloading for development.
- **`env`**: Environment variables:
  - `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`: CA bundle path generated via `python -m unipass`.
  - `PYTHONPATH`: Sets the Python module search path.
  - `OPENAPI_SPEC_PATH`: Path to the OpenAPI specification file.
- **`console`**: Use the integrated terminal for output.
- **`justMyCode`**: Debug only user code (`true`).

### 2. Custom Celery debugger

#### **Purpose**:
This configuration is tailored for debugging Celery workers.

#### **Configuration Details**:

### 3. Custom test debugger

#### **Purpose**:
This configuration is designed to debug python tests.

#### **Configuration Details**:
```json
 {
        "name": "Custom Test Debugger",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "launch",
        "purpose": ["debug-test"],
        "env": {
        "PYTEST_ADDOPTS": "--no-cov"
        },
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "justMyCode": false
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- **`name`**: The identifier for this configuration (`Custom Test Debugger`).
- **`type`**: Specifies the debugger type (`debugpy` for Python debugging).
- **`request`**: Defines the debug request type (`launch` starts the application).
- **`purpose`**: Designated purpose for test debugging.
- **`env`**: Environment variables:
  - `PUTEST_ADDOPTS`: Adds additional options for pytest (`--no-cov` disables coverage reports).

}
```
## Run your debugger

### Step 1
After setting your configuration click on the `Run and Debug` icon locate on the left sidebar (or by shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`) to open the debug view. 

### Step 2
On the top of the view you will find a dropdown list containing your different configuration, chose one debug configuration and press `Start Debugging` button (or by shortcut `F5`).

### Step 3
Check if your debugger is running well in your terminal.
[image-step-3-1]

You can then put some breakpoints, run your scripts and follow the process step by step.

FUNCTIONAL DETAILS

The Automation Team must plan a meeting with other tribes' member when they will be back from holidays (plan now for the future while their calendars are not completely full)












Hi everyone,

Hope you‚Äôre all doing well and enjoying the summer!

The Automation Team would like to plan a short meeting (post-holidays) with members from different tribes to gather your feedback on the current difficulties in updating DMAP. The goal is to understand the pain points and decide whether we should propose a new process to the Security team.

We‚Äôre reaching out now to make sure we can find a slot before everyone‚Äôs calendars start to fill up again. Could you please let us know your general availability for the end of August / early September?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
