I’m going to present the first version of our Named User Access Manager solution, also known as SUAM, developed for SOFA. This solution aims to provide a more efficient and controlled way to manage user access. In this presentation, I will walk you through four key points: first, the reasons behind the need for SUAM in the context of SOFA; second, the main objectives we set out to achieve with this solution; third, how SUAM works in practice; and finally, what the next steps are as we continue to evolve and improve the system.

Currently, the provisioning of users is handled manually for each realm and for every SOFA squad. This process is not only time-consuming, but it also increases the risk of inconsistencies and errors. Users may be provisioned incorrectly, or access rights may not align with actual needs, which can lead to security risks and operational inefficiencies. As the number of users and squads grows, this manual approach becomes increasingly unsustainable. That’s why we’re building SUAM — to streamline and standardize user access management, reduce manual effort, and ensure coherent and secure provisioning across all squads.
