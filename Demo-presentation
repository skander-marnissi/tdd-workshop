I’m going to present the first version of our Named User Access Manager solution, also known as SUAM, developed for SOFA. This solution aims to provide a more efficient and controlled way to manage user access. In this presentation, I will walk you through four key points: first, the reasons behind the need for SUAM in the context of SOFA; second, the main objectives we set out to achieve with this solution; third, how SUAM works in practice; and finally, what the next steps are as we continue to evolve and improve the system.

Currently, the provisioning of users is handled manually for each realm and for every SOFA squad. This process is not only time-consuming, but it also increases the risk of inconsistencies and errors. Users may be provisioned incorrectly, or access rights may not align with actual needs, which can lead to security risks and operational inefficiencies. As the number of users and squads grows, this manual approach becomes increasingly unsustainable. That’s why we’re building SUAM — to streamline and standardize user access management, reduce manual effort, and ensure coherent and secure provisioning across all squads.

Our main objectives with SUAM are threefold. First, we aim to build the core functionality of the solution, laying a solid foundation for managing named user access in a structured and efficient way. Second, we want to integrate SUAM with the SJM and SJ Observability squads as part of the initial rollout, allowing us to validate the solution in real-world use cases. Finally, our goal is to ensure that user provisioning becomes fully automated — eliminating manual steps, reducing errors, and guaranteeing that the process is centralized, auditable, and scalable for future growth.

Let’s walk through how the SUAM solution works using a simple example. Meet Hugo — he needs access to certain SOFA applications, so he submits a provisioning request. The first step is for his manager to validate the request. Once approved, the provisioning process is automatically triggered through SUAM. SUAM then takes over and dispatches the request to all relevant SOFA squads. Each squad, acting on its own scope, provisions Hugo with the appropriate roles in their respective realms. Finally, SUAM receives callbacks from each squad confirming that access has been granted, and Hugo is now fully onboarded with the correct permissions across all targeted applications.
