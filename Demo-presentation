Iâ€™m going to present the first version of our Named User Access Manager solution, also known as SUAM, developed for SOFA. This solution aims to provide a more efficient and controlled way to manage user access. In this presentation, I will walk you through four key points: first, the reasons behind the need for SUAM in the context of SOFA; second, the main objectives we set out to achieve with this solution; third, how SUAM works in practice; and finally, what the next steps are as we continue to evolve and improve the system.
